    "In this project I will be exploring the location data for <b>Toronto, Canada</b> to come up with possible areas that can be used to open an <b>Chinese restaurant</b> This can be used by any stakeholders who may be looking for an optimal location to open a Chinese restaurant. The stakeholders are looking forward to invest in one of these areas and would want a location that they can be able to make the best out of what they are investing that is such that they dont open in a wrong location or a place where they may never be able to make profit since its a business and not some charity organization.\n",
    "So for this project We are going to focus on areas that <b>do not have any Chinese restaurant</b> and as well as areas that are <b>not crowded with any restaurants yet</b>, also we will also look at areas that have a dense population. These will serve as the key elements we will be using for our analysis\n",

This is going to help us get all the venues that are in all the locations in Toronto. The category we are going to be using here is food so that we get only data related to food. With this data we will be analysing to see areas where we can suggest to open the restaurants\n",
    " We will also use the <b>Google's geopy </b> api in order to get the location data of Toronto city like the longitude and latitud. This is going to help us when we are trying to plot the various locations as are on the map of Toronto\n",
